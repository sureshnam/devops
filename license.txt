nonexclusive, nontransferable, revocable, worldwide, fully paid-up license during the term of this 
Agreement, without the right to sublicense, for the sole purpose described in section 1 above under Intel's 
copyrights and Intel's suppliers' copyrights (subject to any third party licensing requirements reflected 
herein, if any), to reproduce the Software internally.
3.	LICENSE RESTRICTIONS.  All right, title and interest in and to the Software and associated documentation

acknowledge that there are significant uses of the Software in its original, unmodified and uncombined form.  
4.	LICENSE TO FEEDBACK AND MODIFICATIONS. This Agreement does not obligate you to provide Intel 
with materials, information, comments, suggestions or other communication regarding the features, 
functions, performance or use of the Software ("Feedback"). To the extent you provide Intel with Feedback, 
You grant to Intel and its affiliates a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, fully paid-up 
and transferable license, with the right to sublicense, to and under any copyrights, trade secrets, patents and 
any other of Your intellectual property rights, whether perfected or not, to publicly perform, publically display, 
reproduce, use, make, have made, sell, offer for sale, distribute, import, create derivative works of and 
otherwise exploit any comments, suggestions, descriptions, ideas or any other feedback provided by or on 
behalf of You regarding the Software.
5.	NO OTHER RIGHTS. Except as otherwise expressly provided above, Intel grants no express or implied 
rights under Intel patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, or other intellectual property rights.  Except 
as expressly stated in this Agreement, no license or right is granted to You directly or by implication, 
inducement, estoppel or otherwise.  Intel has the right to inspect or have an independent auditor inspect 
Your relevant records to verify Your compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
6.	OPEN SOURCE STATEMENT.  The Software includes "Open Source Software" that is licensed pursuant to 
the Open Source Software license agreement(s) identified in the Open Source Software comments in the 
applicable source code file(s) and/or file header(s) provided with or otherwise associated with the Software.  
Additional detail may be provided (where applicable) in the accompanying on-line documentation, or within 
the user interface of the device, if any.  With respect to Open Source Software, nothing in this Agreement 
limits any rights under, or grants rights that supersede, the terms of any applicable Open Source Software 
license agreement.  
7.	CONFIDENTIALITY. Confidential Information (as defined in the CNDA or the RS-NDA) disclosed under this 
Agreement is governed by the Corporate Non-Disclosure Agreement or the Restricted Secret Non-
Disclosure Agreement entered into between the Parties ("CNDA" or "RS-NDA"), which shall govern in all 
conflicts between this Agreement, the CNDA or the RS-NDA.  This Agreement and any related discussions 
are Intel Confidential Information. You will only use Intel Confidential Information to use the Software 
consistent with the license granted to You under this Agreement. You will be fully responsible for any 
confidentiality breach by your employees.  You must not use Intel's name in any publications, 
advertisements, or other announcements without Intel's prior written consent. You do not have any right to 
use any Intel trademarks or logos.
8.	OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE AND COPYRIGHTS. Title to all copies of the Software remains with Intel or 
its suppliers, as applicable. The Software is copyrighted and protected by the laws of the United States and 
other countries, and international treaty provisions. You may not remove any copyright notices from the 
Software. You will retain all legal right, title and interest in and to Your intellectual property and Your 
Datasets You load, operate, test or validate during the Evaluation Period. 
9.	NO OBLIGATION.  You have no duty to purchase or license any product from Intel.  Intel may make 
changes to the Software, or to items referenced therein, at any time without notice, but is not obligated to 
support, update, provide training for or develop a final version of the Software or to license or provide any 
version of it.
10.	EXCLUSION OF WARRANTIES. THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR 
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF ANY KIND INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, 
NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE.  Intel does not warrant or assume responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any 
information, text, graphics, links or other items contained within the Software.
11.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. IN NO EVENT WILL INTEL OR ITS AFFILIATES OR SUPPLIERS 
(INCLUDING THEIR RESPECTIVE DIRECTORS, OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, AND AGENTS) BE LIABLE 
FOR ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, BUSINESS 
INTERRUPTION, OR LOST INFORMATION) ARISING OUT OF OR IN RELATION TO THIS 
AGREEMENT, INCLUDING THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF INTEL HAS 
BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SOME JURISDICTIONS PROHIBIT 
EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONSEQUENTIAL OR 
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY IN PART NOT APPLY TO YOU. YOU MAY 
ALSO HAVE OTHER LEGAL RIGHTS THAT VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THE 
LIMITED REMEDIES, WARRANTY DISCLAIMER AND LIMITED LIABILITY ARE FUNDAMENTAL 
ELEMENTS OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN INTEL AND YOU. AND INTEL WOULD NOT 
BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THE SOFTWARE WITHOUT SUCH LIMITATIONS. 
12.	TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement will terminate on the expiration date set forth 
below, except paragraphs 4 and 9, which will survive termination or expiration.  If no expiration date is set, 
the Agreement expires 12 months after its execution.  Intel may terminate this Agreement immediately by 
providing you with notice of the termination at the contact address set forth below if you provide any 
information that is false or inaccurate. Upon termination, all licenses granted to You hereunder will 
immediately terminate and You will immediately destroy the Software (including providing certification of 
such destruction back to Intel) or return all copies of the Software to Intel.
13.	APPLICABLE LAWS. All matters arising out of or related to this Agreement, including without limitation all 
matters connected with its performance, will be construed, interpreted, applied and governed in all respects 
in accordance with the laws of the United States of America and the State of Delaware, without reference to 
conflict of laws principles.  All disputes and litigation arising out of or related to this Agreement, including 
without limitation matters connected with its performance, will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the 
courts of the State of Delaware or of the Federal courts sitting therein. Each party hereby irrevocably 
submits to the personal jurisdiction of such courts and irrevocably waives all objections to such venue. The 
parties agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is 
specifically excluded from application to this Agreement. 
14.	EXPORT REGULATIONS/EXPORT CONTROL. You will not export, either directly or indirectly, the 
Software without first obtaining any required license or other approval from the U.S. Department of 
Commerce or any other agency or department of the United States Government.  In the event the Software 
is exported from the United States or re-exported from a foreign destination by You, You will ensure that the 
distribution and export/re-export or import of the Software is in compliance with all laws, regulations, orders, 
or other restrictions of the U.S. Export Administration Regulations and the appropriate foreign government. 
You agree that neither You nor your subsidiaries will export/re-export the Software, directly or indirectly, to 
any country for which the United States government or any agency thereof or the foreign government from 
where it is shipping requires an export license, or other governmental approval, without first obtaining such 
license or approval. 
15.	GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS. The Software is a "commercial item" as that term is defined in 48 
C.F.R. 2.101, consisting of "commercial computer software" and "commercial computer software 
documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212. Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 
C.F.R 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4, You will not provide the Software to the U.S. Government.

16.	ASSIGNMENT. You may not delegate, assign or transfer this Agreement, the license(s) granted or any of 
Your rights or duties hereunder, expressly, by implication, by operation of law, or otherwise and any attempt 
to do so, without Intel's express prior written consent, will be null and void. Intel may assign, delegate and 
transfer this Agreement, and its rights and obligations hereunder, in its sole discretion. 
17.	ENTIRE AGREEMENT. The terms and conditions of this Agreement, and the CNDA and the RS-NDA 
constitute the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and merge 
and supersede all prior, contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions. 
Neither of the parties hereto will be bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings 
or representations with respect to the subject matter hereof other than as expressly provided for herein. 
Each party is not obligated under any other agreements unless they are in writing and signed by an 
authorized representative of each party. 
18.	SEVERABILITY. In the event that any provision of this Agreement will be unenforceable or invalid under any 
applicable law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity will not render 
this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole, and, in such event, such provision will be changed and 
interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of such unenforceable or invalid provision within the 
limits of applicable law or applicable court decisions. 
19.	WAIVER. The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision hereof will not 
affect the full right to require such performance at any time thereafter; nor will the waiver by either party of a 
breach of any provision hereof be taken or held to be a waiver of the provision itself.
